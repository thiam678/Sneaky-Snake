# Sneaky-Snake
A lightweight, browser-based arcade game that puts core JavaScript concepts into motion. Players navigate a pixel-style snake across the screen using keyboard controls, with real-time movement governed by dynamic event listeners. As the snake consumes items and grows, the game updates the DOM to reflect changes, increase speed, and track scores.
